    Description:

        The OOI Level 1 Seafloor Pressure core data products, SFLPRES and
        sub-parameters SFLPRES-RTIME, SFLPRES-TIDE, and SFLPRES-WAVE, are
        created from the Sea-Bird Electronics SBE 26plus member of the Seafloor
        Pressure (SFL, PRESF) family of instruments by either a) polling, in
        real-time, for L0 ASCII text format data output and converting from
        psia to decibar units or b) converting, after instrument recovery, L0
        hexadecimal pressure data into decimal format and the resulting tide
        and wave pressure data in psia to decibar units.

        This code creates the SFLPRES-WAVE data product.

    Implemented by:

        2014-09-23: Christopher Wingard. Initial code
        2015-07-20: Russell Desiderio. Modified code to accept p_dec_wave as 2D array.
        2015-07-22: Russell Desiderio. Added call to replace_fill_with_nan.
        2023-08-15: Samuel Dahlberg. Removed use of Numexpr library.
